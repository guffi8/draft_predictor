DraftPrediction.R uses files that are in training_data folder.
The output of DraftPrediction.R is written into Vectors folder, we already put the output into this folder
in case you won't run the R script.

DraftPredictor.py uses the files that been written by the R script - The files that in Vectors folder.
By running DraftPredictor.py you can see our prediction to 2017 draft and 2011 draft - as we wrote in our pdf file.

ScreenCast - screen recording of running the code.

You should unzip the zip file first to execute the R and Python Code.


Thanks!
